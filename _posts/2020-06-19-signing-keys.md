PGP keys

You may or may not have noticed that I recently started signing commits and I
do plan on doing so in the future.  This will include signing release archives.

If you want to verify these signatures, you can get the key for the the
identity `ada.rocks@jlfencey.com` from some public keyservers, notably

[keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org).

The key's fingerprint id should match
