You may or may not have noticed that I recently started signing commits and I
do plan on doing so in the future.  This will include signing release archives.

If you want to verify these signatures, you can get the key for the the
identity `ada.rocks@jlfencey.com` from selected public key servers, notably

[keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org).

[Download the key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/6C1001515C1951D0E78E150EC8D512005D2D8667).

The key's fingerprint id should match
